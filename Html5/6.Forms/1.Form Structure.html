<h1>Form Structure</h1>
<p>
Form is create by using "form>" element.Form element always carry "Action" attribute.The value of the action attribute will be the url where we submit<br/><br/>
Beside "action" attribute another attribute is "Method" attribute.Posts can be send to the server through either "Get Method" or "Post Method".Default method will be "Get Method".<br/>
* <b>"Get Method"</b> will use when form is not too big.Also we don't use this method in case of privacy of posts,as the information we entered will be shown at the end of the url.<br/>
With the Get Method,the length of a URL is limited(2,048 characters).<br/>
Never use GET to send sensitive data(data will be visible in the URLS).<br/>
GET method is better for non-secure data,like query strings in Google.<br/>

* <b>"Post Methods"</b> can be use to send sensitive informations also,like passwords.And also for longer informations.<br/>
POST has no size limitations and can be used to send large amounts of data.
